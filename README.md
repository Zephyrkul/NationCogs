# NationCogs
NationStates utility cogs (and a fun Skryim guard lines cog) for use with [Red-DiscordBot](https://github.com/Twentysix26/Red-DiscordBot)

If you have any issues, feel free to contact me via Discord through the [Red server](https://discord.gg/red) or via NationStates by telegramming [Darcania](https://www.nationstates.net/page=compose_telegram?tgto=darcania) or posting in [this forum thread](https://forum.nationstates.net/viewtopic.php?f=15&t=402202).

All cogs beginning with `ns` require the [NationStates python wrapper](https://github.com/Dolphman/pynationstates). Your bot should automatically install it, but if it does not, 1) update your bot through the launcher, and/or 2) run `[p]debug bot.pip_install('nationstates')`, which will return `True` if the installation succeeded.

Download through your Red bot with:
`[p]cog repo add NationCogs https://github.com/zephyrkul/NationCogs`
